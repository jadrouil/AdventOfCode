Timeline/Goals:

Most of the days I coded in ruby because I was just learning the language at the time and wanted to become more familiar with it


days 1 and 2 simply coded for completion
day3 I began trying to follow SOLID principles
day4 I began trying to use test driven development and the solid principles
